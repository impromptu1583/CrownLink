### CrownLink
Crownlink is a networking provider that is compatible with blizzard's storm-based games from the 90s. It's specifically developed with the starcraft overhaul [Cosmonarchy](https://fraudsclub.com/cosmonarchy-bw/) in mind, but should work for other blizzard games from the era.

## Usage
Download the latest `CrownLink.snp` from releases and drop it in your game directory next to the default ones. For Cosmonarchy this is typically `C:\Cosmonarchy\Starcraft\`. You should have a new entry in the multiplayer menu show up.

## Connection modes / tags
You may see games in the multiplayer menu tagged with `[Relayed]` in the game name. This means direct peer to peer communication couldn't be established and a TURN relay server is in use. Performance may not be as good as a direct peer to peer connection.

This version of the code has some files from [BWAPI](https://github.com/bwapi/bwapi) and is therefore licensed GPLv3. (TODO: update licenses file)
